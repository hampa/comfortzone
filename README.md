#### <a name="kickbaba"></a> Kick Baba 

A Kick bass module for psy trance rolling kbbb beats.

Features:
 - Different saw waves
 - Kich pitch envelopes
 - Saw wave morphing
 - Retriggers
 - Usefull envelope outputs for song structure

Filter code is from the excellent VCV Ripples (https://github.com/VCVRack/AudibleInstruments)

#### <a name="tzfmlead"></a> TZFM Lead 

TZFM Lead is an oscillator that performs through zero frequency modulation on a pair of interal waves.

Instead of tuning it with an external modulatation source TZFM Lead outputs the carrier, modulator and resulting TZFM wave.

Left and right output should preferably run into a nice band pass filter such as VCV Ripples.

Features:
 - 5 different wave types for both modulator and carrier (sin, tri, saw, ramp, square, polybleep saw, polybleep square)
 - Always in tune
 - Handy octave switchers for both modulator and carrier 
 - CV input for Frequency Modulation amount
 - Unison detune for stereo output

Oscillator code is from Electro Smith (https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyExamples)
